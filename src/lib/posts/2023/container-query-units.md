## What this article stemmed from

When recreating my blog recently, I wanted to use as many of the handy new CSS features as I could, including container query units. When looking for more information about container query units, I found Stephanie Eckles' handy article about [using container query units for typography](https://moderncss.dev/container-query-units-and-fluid-typography/) but it only covered a subset of my thinking around how they could and should be used. The other articles I found were created before container query units' syntax were finalized and released. I hope this article helps fill the gaps for others wanting learn more about them going forwards!
