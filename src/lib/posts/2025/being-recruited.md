I'm always open to getting messages from companies. I like hearing about companies that I haven't heard of and learning more about ones I have heard of. But the vast majority of recruiting messages are not good, especially for staff+ candidates.

## What makes a good recruiting message?

I can't tell you how many times I've received a cold-call message that's like,

<blockquote>
  <p>Want to change the world at the next $1B biotech company?</p>

  <p>We're redefining how medical analysis is done using AI. Think Theranos but real.</p>

  <p>Our founders Chad and Brad are from Facebook and Uber. We've already raised a $17M series A and have 70% MoM growth.</p>

  <p>You look like you'd be a great candidate because of your experience at &lt;two most recent companies listed on LinkedIn&gt;.</p>

  <p>Ready to level up your game and learn more? Find a time here.</p>
</blockquote>

  <strong>Aside:</strong> Big tech doesn't really have to recruit like this because of their name recognition, so I'm not really talking about them here.

I have never been a recruiter, so I don't know what it's like. I know they are playing a numbers game and trying to cast a wide net to find qualified candidates.

But to me, messages like this are not appealing. If I were desperate for a job I might respond. But are those the only candidates that you want to hire?

If you're a startup cold-calling people trying to get good talent, it's unlikely that you'll be able to offer a salary higher than most big tech companies. So you need to stand out by investing more time.

  <strong>Aside:</strong> I dislike when recruiters add me as a connection on LinkedIn and send a message as a part of that request. I always report that "I don't know this person". Just message me directly. If I engage, maybe we can connect.

Here's what I think might _actually_ get my attention:

### A very personalized message

Don't just mention the companies that I've worked at or the titles that I've had. Send a personalized message that calls out what you like about my work and how it fits into your vision for the role and the direction of the company. I've shared a lot online! Make use of it and get to know me a bit. If you're not willing to at least click through my Bluesky profile and read my blog, how can you know that I'm a good fit?

Explain in detail why you think I _specifically_ am a fit for your team at this point in time. Why me over someone else?

And don't craft it with AI -- it's obvious.

### Sell your vision

Explain why your company / goals are interesting. Why do you do what you do? Why should I work for your company over countless other companies? How does that align with my interests? This means that the message should probably come from a founder or at least someone within the company, even if a third party company sourced me as a candidate.

I lead a productive team at a Fortune 500 company. If you're an early-stage startup, why should I take the risk?

Be specific.

This means that **_you should put the name of the company, a link to the company's website, and a job posting in the message!_** I never thought I'd have to tell recruiters to say what company they're recruiting for but I've gotten so many messages without it that I had to include this.

This also means that I'm not interested in pool hiring unless that pool is for a specific subset of teams that align specifically with my interests.

## What I'm looking for

I really love being able to direct what my team is working on while also build things myself. I love creating efficient processes for high quality teams and code. I excel at both making top-tier marketing websites and building enterprise software.

I want you to be excited at the prospect of us working together, not just one of many candidates. If you're not a little sad if I turn down the position then I'm probably not right for the role.

Like I said, I'm always open to hearing from you.
