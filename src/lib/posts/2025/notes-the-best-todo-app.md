Creating a TODO app is a software engineering trope. I think every software engineer feels the need to create their own at some point or another.

But in the end most engineers that I know [end up using a plain text file](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=hacker+news+i+tried+every+todo+app). I was one of those people for a while, using Window's Notepad as my TODO app.

However in the last few years I've found myself using Apple's Notes app more often due to a few key features that it offers.

## Automatic syncing

Having a note automatically sync between my phone a desktop saves a good chunk of time, especially when I don't have my phone on me when get on my laptop.

Admittedly the Notes syncing is not great, especially when editing the same note on both my phone and laptop. I also find myself quitting and restarting the Notes app on my laptop any time that I need it to get changes I made on my phone.

But the syncing functionality that it offers is better than having to email the `.txt` file (or its contents) to myself in order to sync it across devices.

## Draggable list items

Sometimes I want to reorder list items, particularly when I want to plan the order of completing my list. With a plain text file, that means cutting and pasting (often with some reformatting involved). With Notes, you can drag and drop list items.

The drag and drop behavior is a bit buggy, especially when dragging past the current displayed screen size, but it works most of the time.

## Checkbox lists

I used to use plain bullets for my lists, removing each item as I went. But sometimes I wanted a record of each item I did when I completed them. When that happened I would manually replace the `-` with a `X` to indicate the item was completed without deleting it. But that's a hassle.

In Notes you can use a checkbox list instead of a bulleted list to give each item a checkbox to indicate done or not.

## Multiple notes

This is minor, but Notes makes it easy to have and switch between multiple notes. I have one note that I use for most of my day-to-day tasks and a separate note for my "when I can get around to it" personal tasks.

## Shared notes

My wife and I recently had a daughter! One implication of this is that we have very little time to do anything, including communicating to each other what we need to do.

We've started using a shared Note with a running tasklist. It's easy to add to from our phones and keeps us organized to make sure we don't miss something that we need to do that day.

## Conclusion

I'm not an Apple fan. Notes itself has even more issues than I listed above.

But at the end of the day the Notes app is the right amount of usefulness without so many extra things as to make it a hassle to use. It's a hangover from the Jobs era of Apple.
